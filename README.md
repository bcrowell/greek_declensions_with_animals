Animals in Homeric Greek: practice with the declensions
=======================================================

This is a 30-minute audio workout with the declensions of nouns in Homeric Greek, using
animals as the nouns. It's meant to be optimized for practice in the car.

This is intended for review and reinforcement, not initial learning.
The recording doesn't make any attempt to teach you the declensions from scratch, but
if you know the general ideas about genders, the three declensions, and the cases,
then you should be able to figure it out. Answers are provided in the file answers.txt.

The recording introduces you to the whole list of animal vocabulary words, in the
nominative and genitive, but doesn't tell you in English what they are. The file
all-animals.svg shows you this using pictures above the written Greek words.

# Pronunciation

The pronunciation is a pretty standard US Erasmian, with tonal accents. I pronounce
upsilon like "oo" in "look."
